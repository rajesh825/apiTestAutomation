# Test Observations

1. Login Error message "Missing password" not ideal, inline with Security Standards.
   Should be changed to "invalid Credentials" inline with OWASP Guidance

2. Login Successful, even though user provides empty password
    eg: {
            "email": "peter@klaven",
            "password": ""
        }

3. Even though User created successfully using "POST /api/users", Get User not returning corresponding user details.


# Potential Improvements For Future

  a. Configure Tests to run in Groups
  b. Configure Tests to run in paralell
